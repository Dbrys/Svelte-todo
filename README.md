## About

This simple todo app serve as my introduction to Svelte and Sveltekit. Through building this app, I explored the flexibility and performance benefits that Svelte offers for developing modern web applications.

## Running locally

Once you've forked the project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a build and preview the app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.
