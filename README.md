## About

This simple todo app serves as my introduction to Svelte and Sveltekit. Through building this app, I explored the flexibility and performance benefits that Svelte offers for developing modern web applications.

## Running locally

Once you've forked the project and installed dependencies with `pnpm install`, the app can be run locally with below commands:

```bash
pnpm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `pnpm run preview`.
